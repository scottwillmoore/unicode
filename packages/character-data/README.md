# Unicode Character Data

[Unicode Standard Annex #44, Unicode Character Database](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/).

Unicode properties can be [simple](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Simple_Props) or [derived](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Derived_Props).

Unicode properties have [default values](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Use_Default) for instances when unassigned.

Unicode properties can be [obsolete](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Obsolete_Properties), [deprecated](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Deprecated_Properties) or [stabilized](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Stabilized_Properties).

The formal definitions related to character properties are also documented by the Unicode Standard in [Section 3.5, Properties](https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch03.pdf).

In addition, a discussion on the property model used in the Unicode Character database is outlined in the [Unicode Standard Annex #23, The Unicode Character Property Model](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr23/). However, over the years various content from it has been incorporated into normative portions of the Unicode Standard.

The [files](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#UCD_Files) in the Unicode Character Database follow a common [format convention](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Format_Conventions).

There is a [list of properties](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Properties), where properties can be of [different types](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Type_Key_Table).

The [API of ICU4J](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4j/) provides a reasonable interface to model a library on.
